title: Setting up AWS Secrets Manager
---

Before you can deploy your application stack, you must first create a Secret in [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/).

This secret will secure the creation of the stack (ensures you have the right to associate your content in OC Studio with your AWS account) and secures the communication with your application stack and OC Studio during runtime.
