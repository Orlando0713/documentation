## Authentication

For single tenant solutions running on AWS, we will most likely setup Amazon Cognito as the authentication method.  From the Cognito console, you can manage your users.

:::important
Self-provisioning is turned off by default which means you, an admin, will have to manually provision your users if you have not setup Federated identities.  
:::

You will see a user pool called:

```
StentorCognitoUserPool
```

which was generated by the Cloudformation script and is where you can manage your users.

### Adding a User

Within the Cognito service console, click the `StentorCognitoUserPool` then:

1. Select "Create User" on the right hand side under the Users section
2. Select "Send an email invitation"
3. Enter the new user's email address
4. Select "Set a password" under Temporary Password
5. Last, click "Create User"

The user will then get an email with the email and password that they will need to use to login to your single tenant instance for the first time.  Most likely, the user will then need to be invited to an organization within Studio single tenant using the same email.
